This website is my web developement project with using Express JS for the first time. Following technologies were used:
* Express JS as a web server
* EJS as a templating engine
* Sass
* Bootstrap 3
* Git and GitHub
* Gulp as a task runner with following dependencies:
  * bootstrap-sass
  * browserify as bundler
  * browser-sync for live reload
  * jQuery to work with bootstrap
  * autoprefixer, nodemon and few more (see package.json for details)
